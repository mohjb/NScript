# NScript
A visual programming environment based on C-language and OpenGL

the initiale idea is simple, a C-struct ( struct N, hence the name NScript) that can be used for JSON, a C-union that can be  Json Obj or Json-array or the rest of the Json constructs. And in addition , in the same C-struct meta-data (a Json-obj) is associated, hence the meta data can hold visual data using json, then we have an atomic language construct that can use visualizations

From there, variables, block statements, methods , threads, classes, FSM (finite-state-machines) and algorithms,and such, can be conceptualized visually.
Not only the details can be visualized, but also a top-bottom approach can be crystalized before the implementation is worked out, leading to better designs , and hopefully , long term goals can always be kept in sight. Processes can be visualized and objectified. hence abstractions and other object oriented component concepts can be mapped to visuals.

Behaviours and plans can be laid-out , leading to better and more functional communication between team members and higher roles of an institute.

When diagrams are morphed into living machines, stack holders usually start being better objectively constructive and imaginative, leading to improvement in the feedback cycle and improvements of the institute's success rate and its competitiveness .

Having said that, the proposed scripting engine requires a lot of creative ground work in features: with creative insights in networking protocols. Innovative data-structures and their strategies. Drawing out the roles of user autherizations. Overhaul in the way Storage is conceptualized, where the concept of storage has mostly been held back due to technical details. if the unnecessary technical details can be removed from the process of development, potential new features will arise.

In conclusion , programming languages were always held back due to grammar details which are not part of any application goals nor application features, and usually the grammar imposes time-obstacles, grammars are usually not one to one with the application nor the design nor the optimization of processes. This project attempts to rethink programming and unleashing the potential of modern ITC infra-structures, by animating the Visuals of Concepts and dynamically presenting designs, and offering live Controls over the system.

The current state of development , is to write a C based json parser that generates a tree of struct-N nodes

where a StrBuf struct and functions iare invented as string buffer
and a JsonPrsr struct and functions are invented as the Json parser

memory management is an issue with C, and considerations are taken in the JsonPrsr for StrBuf.
